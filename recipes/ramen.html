        <li>Spring onions (scallions)</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Fresh red chili (or dried red chili)</li>
        <li>Light soy sauce</li>

        <li>Fresh shiitake mushrooms (or dried shiitake mushrooms)</li>
        <li>Dried ramen noodles</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol class="dir">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).</li>
        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!</li>
